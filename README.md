# JM Trello Boost
This is an app bootstrapped according to the [T3-Stack](https://beta.create.t3.gg).
With the following technologies pre-setup by t3:
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

The aim of this app is just create a simple trello power up with absolute overkill of a setup.
I don't really know if this is overkill, but it kinda feels like it. This is mostly just messing around
